# Logos Search

Raycast extension with two commands that open verses and resources in Logos Bible Software.

## Commands

### Open Verse in Logos

- Accepts input like `nasb John 3:16` (alias + reference) or `John 3:16` (reference only).
- Resolves Bible version aliases defined in command preferences.
- Builds a ref.ly deep link and opens it in Logos (optional clipboard copy for debugging).
- Validates empty input and unknown aliases with clear toasts.

### Search Library

- Reads the local Logos `catalog.db`, indexes titles, authors, abbreviations, and resource IDs.
- Provides a Raycast list with fuzzy search, loading state, and quick actions to open or copy links.
- Caches the parsed catalog to speed up future runs and exposes a Rebuild Index action.
- Falls back gracefully when the database is missing or permissions block access.

## Configuration

### Version Aliases (Open Verse command)

- **Default Version** is required (for example `esv`).
- **Version Aliases** accepts either JSON (`{"nasb":"nasb95"}`) or `alias=version` lines:
  ```text
  nasb=nasb95
  nkjv=nkjv
  ```
- Unknown aliases surface a toast so you can adjust preferences quickly.

### Catalog Database (Search Library command)

- Automatically locates the most recent `catalog.db` under `~/Library/Application Support/Logos4/Data/*/LibraryCatalog/`.
- Provide a custom path in preferences to override auto-discovery (tilde expansion supported).
- Use the Action Panel to rebuild the index after purchasing resources or to reveal the database in Finder.

### Open Schemes

- Verses currently use `ref.ly` links for reliability.
- Library resources try `logosres:{id}` first and fall back to `logos4:Open?resource={id}` if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- Launch Logos once so the catalog database exists before running the Search Library command.
- If macOS blocks disk access, grant Raycast (or the Raycast Extension development environment) **Full Disk Access** and rerun indexing.
- When deep links fail to open Logos, copy the URL from the toast/clipboard and test it in a browser to verify the handler.
